<h1>Purpose</h1>
<h3>This project was created as a template for a travel brochure site. The page consists of a home page, a top 5 list for different categories, and separate, more detailed pages for the full lists.</h3>
<h1>Participants</h1>
<h3>Gurinderpreet Singh</h3>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<h3>The creation of a brochure site has to incorporate the area in more ways than just pictures. In order to achieve this, I picked a focus area, India, and tried to incorporate a defining aspect. </h3>
<h3>The aspect I chose to focus on was the national flag and its colors.</h3>
<h1>Future Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Improvements in overall design to create a visually appealing display.</li>
<li>Improvements to responsive design for better flow in various sized screens.</li>
<li>Additional pages focused on specific destinations to provide more information.</li>
</ul>
